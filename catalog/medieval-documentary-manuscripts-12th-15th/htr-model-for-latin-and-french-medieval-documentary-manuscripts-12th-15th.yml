transcription-guidelines: "(1) As in most diplomatic editions the abbreviations have been resolved, both those by suspension (facimꝰ ---> facimus) and by contraction (dñi --> domini). Likewise, those using conventional signs (⁊ --> et ; ꝓ --> pro) have been resolved. \n(2) The named entities (names of persons, places and institutions) have been capitalized. The beginning of a block of text as well as the original capitals used by the writer are also capitalized.\n(3) The consonantal \" i \" and \" u \" characters have been transcribed as \" j \" and \" v \" in both French and Latin.\n(4) The punctuation marks used in the manuscript are not always followed in the transcription as this have been standardized in editions with modern punctuation.\n(5) The marginal annotations and entries (most of them introduced after the manuscript composition) have not been systematically transcribed."
